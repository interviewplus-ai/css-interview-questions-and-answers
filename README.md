## 1. What is CSS and how is it used in web development?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

## 2. What are the different ways to include CSS in a web page?

CSS can be included in a web page using three different methods:

Inline CSS:

```html
<p style="color: red;">This is some text.</p>
```

Internal CSS:

```html
<style>
    p {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

External CSS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

## 3. What is the CSS box model?

The CSS box model is a layout model that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. The size of an element is calculated by adding up these components.

## 4. How do you center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS?

To center an element horizontally, you can use the margin: 0 auto; property. To center an element vertically, you can combine display: flex; and align-items: center; properties.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

## 5. What are media queries in CSS? Provide an example.

Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser window. They are commonly used for creating responsive web designs.

Example of a media query for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}
```

## 6. What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of different types of selectors.

A CSS selector is used to target specific HTML elements for styling. Examples of CSS selectors include:

- Element selector: 'p { color: red; }'
- Class selector: '.highlight { background-color: yellow; }'
- ID selector: '#navbar { font-weight: bold; }'
- Attribute selector: 'input[type="text"] { border: 1px solid gray; }'

## 7. What is the difference between class and id in CSS? Provide examples.

In CSS, a class is used to style multiple elements, while an ID is used to style a unique element.

Example of a class selector:

```html
<p class="highlight">This is some text.</p>
css
Copy code
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

Example of an ID selector:

```html
<p id="title">Welcome to my website.</p>
css
Copy code
#title {
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

## 8. What is the difference between margin and padding in CSS?

Margin is the space outside an element, creating space between elements, while padding is the space inside an element, creating space between the element's content and its border.

```css
.box {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

## 9. How do you create a CSS gradient? Provide an example.

CSS gradients allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. There are two types of gradients: linear and radial.

Example of a linear gradient:

```css
.box {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
}
```

Example of a radial gradient:

```css
.box {
    background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);
}
```

## 10. What is the box-sizing property in CSS? Explain its values.

The box-sizing property is used to control the box model of an element. It specifies whether an element's width and height should include padding and border or not.

Possible values:

- content-box (default): Width and height only include content.
- border-box: Width and height include content, padding, and border.

```css
.box {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    width: 200px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

##  11. How do you create a sticky/fixed header in CSS? Provide an example.

To create a sticky/fixed header that remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls, you can use the position: fixed; property.

```css
.header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: gray;
}
```

## 12. How do you center an element horizontally in CSS? Provide examples.

To center an element horizontally, you can use the text-align: center; property for inline elements or the margin: 0 auto; property for block-level elements.

```css
.container {
    text-align: center;
}

.box {
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 200px;
}
```

## 13. How do you create a responsive layout using CSS Grid? Provide an example.

CSS Grid allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts with grid-based placement of elements.

Example of a responsive grid layout:

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}
```

##  14. How do you create a CSS animation? Provide an example.

CSS animations allow you to animate CSS properties to create interactive effects.

Example of a CSS animation:

```css
@keyframes rotate {
    from {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
}

.box {
    animation: rotate 2s linear infinite;
}
```
